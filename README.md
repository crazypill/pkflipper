PkFlipper: Flipping Bits with PsychoKinesis

Based on the the Global Consciousness Project, PkFlipper is a game of using your mind to influence the outcome of a Hardware Random Number Generator. This RNG uses the avalanche effect in a semiconductor junction to generate true random numbers, unlike a typical computer based deterministic random bit generator (pseudorandom number generator). According to studies, these types of HRNG devices can be influenced by human consciousness and intent.

Bringing People Together Through High Scores

A one minute game happens every 2 minutes. 200 bits are counted 20 times a second during this minute. That works out to 100 bits on average over the minute. The Chi-Square Test is used to accumulate the amount of variation from the theoretical variation of 0.  An average accumulation without conscious intervention is somewhere around 600 over the one minute period.  Anything above or below that value is significant. The more people focusing the on the same intent, skewing the RNG average, the more likely it is to happen. Ideally, this is a multiplayer game and location should not matter. However, there is no reason one person can't skew the average.
